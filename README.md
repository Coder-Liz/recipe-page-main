## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This exercise not only improved my coding skills but also sharpened my eye for design details and enhanced my ability to translate visual concepts into functional web pages.

### Continued development

Recreating a design from visual reference is kinda challenging. I only guess the spacing between element and font-size required but I am hoping that I will learn also about designing on figma. Overall, I really need to learn more about everything.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I checked this platform to learn about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
